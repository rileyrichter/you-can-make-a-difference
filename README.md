## You can make a difference!

This is a repo to hold code used for a free Webflow cloneable.

You can find the site at [https://you-can-make-a-difference.webflow.io/](https://you-can-make-a-difference.webflow.io/).

The site is designed to make it to make online activism easy. With Webflow, it's easy to build sites without using code. This site makes it easy to get started raising awareness for issues.

If you have a community you work with and you need to make it easy for them to contact their representatives, then this site is for you.

The backend of elected officials uses Parabola to sync the data at [Pro Publica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) with the Webflow CMS. I'm working on making it easy for you to use the same flow with your site.
